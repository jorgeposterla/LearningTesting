# LearningTesting

This project is a collection of exercises and examples for test automation using Selenium and C#. The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for learning and practicing test automation skills using these technologies.

## Automation Framework

The repository includes a basic automation framework built on Selenium and C#. This framework provides a solid foundation for creating and executing automated tests efficiently. It includes the following features:

- Configuration of Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web browsers.
- Base classes for creating pages and UI components.
- Common methods and utilities for interacting with page elements, waits, screenshots, etc.
- Sample test cases and best practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **src**: Contains the source code of the automation framework.
- **tests**: Contains sample test cases using the framework.

## Framework Credits

This project is based on a basic framework created by [cmm777](https://github.com/cmm777/Project/tree/master). I will be adding parts to it as I practice and learn.
